= First <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> Congress

The <span style="color: #000000;">Christian People's Party</span> (<span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>) has officially been founded! Adam Stegerwald, orchestrator of this arrangement and leader of the former <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, has been chosen as the interim leader of the new party.

The <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>'s inaugural congress will play a major role in shaping the direction of the newly founded party, and to elect a new chairman. It finally looks like we might have some competition now.

subtitle: The factions of the two parties shall reorganize into blocs.

The merger of the two parties also brings together the many factions of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. Though they now share a party banner, deep factional divides remain, and infighting continues to plague the new organizationâ€”at least until the party congress settles the balance of power.

The reorganized factions are as follows:

Somewhat surprisingly, <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> leader Adam Stegerwald is elected as the chairman of its successor party. This is largely attributed to the unified support from the various Christian labor unions and backing from former <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and Catholic politicians. However, he remains largely opposed by former <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> members due to his willingness to cooperate constructively with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

It was widely expected that, with the merger of the two parties, politicians like Stegerwald would shift to the left wing of the newly created partyâ€”and this has indeed proven true. His strongest supporters, aside from the trade unions, include the now strengthened <span style="color: #FF7F00;">Christian Left</span> faction, which will push for a paternalistic economic policy and greater cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>. Stegerwald is also a committed <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span>, a stance that has pushed some ardent monarchists over to the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>.

Somehow, the <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Social</span> wing, now diluted within a much larger party, has managed to elect one of their own as the leader of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>. Walther Lambach, the writer of the Lambach article years ago[? if dnvp_leader == "Lambach":, and the most recent leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?], has won the vote largely due to the unified support of the Christian labor unions, who strongly back his vision for a *Volksgemeinschaft*.

More <span style="color: #c00000;">worker-friendly</span> policies have been added to the platform, such as expanding social welfare, increasing pensions, and implementing more progressive income taxes. They've even rejected austerity as a solution to Germany's current economic crisis, instead voicing support for public works. However, this has significantly strained industrial enthusiasm for the formation of the new party, and they have begun redirecting funds toward the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>.

This, however, is not good news for us. <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Social</span> ideology is deeply rooted in antisemitism, racism, nationalism, and religiosity. If anything, we've noticed worsening relations with the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>, as they attempt to present a non-<span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxist</span> alternative to the workers.

# support losses are because he is a c*tholic

Konrad Adenauer, the long-time Mayor of Cologne, has been elevated to the leadership of one of Germany's largest parties, which he strongly supported the formation of. Adenauer is committed to democratic principles and sits on the right wing of the former <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, without being tied to Christian labor.

GÃ¼nther Gereke, a lawyer and prominent politician from rural Germany, has been elected as the new leader of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>. What makes him notable is that he is an <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span> politician from west of the Elbe River, a leading reformist economic theorist, and someone with close ties to General Kurt von Schleicher. He bears similarities to Treviranus, though he is far less dogmatic in his beliefs.

Thanks to Gerekeâ€™s strong relationship with the <span style="color: #7FCEB1;">**CNBLP**</span>, a rural special-interest party, he has successfully negotiated a merger of the declining party into the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>, though only a few officials remain in the effectively dead party. His support for a public works program has stemmed criticism from the labor factions, and his ability to unite the key interest groups on which the German Right depends on will help secure strong <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalist</span> backing for the party.

Needless to say, this has not sat well with the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>â€™s Catholic wing, and has made cooperation within the party impossible for the foreseeable future.

This has earned him nearly universal support within the party.

However, Bolz's role as a compromise candidate has hindered his ability to effect significant change, as he must tread carefully to avoid alienating the factions that helped bring him to power.

Goerdeler's role as a compromise candidate has hindered his ability to effect significant change, as he must tread carefully to avoid alienating the factions that helped bring him to power. I actually don't know what to write for this guy, his WW2 anti-Nazi plots aren't relevant at this time since he viewed Hitler as an enlightened dictator at this time.

A key figure of the German Right since the Republic's inception, Kuno von Westarp has ascended to the leadership role of the colossal <span style="color: #000000;">Christian People's Party</span>â€”certainly a significant step up. His election was primarily driven by the unified support of the entire former <span style="color: #3E88B3;">nationalist</span> faction within the party.

Westarp is highly experienced in managing internal dissent and is careful not to lean too heavily into any one particular wing of the party, aiming to avoid fracturing the organization. While the party program remains largely unchanged, there has been a noticeable increase in antisemitic and pro-monarchist rhetoric, as Westarp seeks to preserve the character of the now-defunct <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> within this new entity.

Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck is a war hero renowned for his undefeated record and his successful guerrilla campaign in German East Africa, with victories that rival those of Hindenburg. Despite multiple attempts to involve him in German politics, he has remained largely inactive, serving as a member of the Reichstag elected under the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. However, the [? if vorbeck_deadlock: unending deadlock at the congress?][? if not vorbeck_deadlock and vorbeck_decline: drastic decline in the moderate right's vote share?][? if not vorbeck_deadlock and not vorbeck_decline and vorbeck_presidential: desire to utilize his character for a potential future election run?] has led to a growing number of factions rallying around his candidacy. The widespread popular support for him draws strong parallels to Hindenburg's own presidential candidacy declaration in 1925.

Reluctantly, Lettow-Vorbeck has accepted the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span>'s nomination as their next leader. However, he has little interest in managing the partyâ€™s internal affairs and has quietly delegated this responsibility to fellow conservatives like Westarp. Nonetheless, he remains the public face of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> as chairman. The most crucial aspect of his election is his ability to inspire the German people to rally behind a Great War war hero once again, someone who embodies the image of stability and unity. Time will tell how long this popularity will last.

It goes without saying, his election will make cooperation within the party impossible for the foreseeable future.
